Makes browsing through projects with multiple files and lots of functions easier.

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li> Shows all functions/macros from a procedure file including parameter types, return types and special properties (like static, threadsafe, etc.)
<li> Alphabetically sorted list of functions/macro
<li> Allows jumping to their definitions by mouse and keyboard
<li> Works with Independent Modules
</ul>

For reasons of ease-of-use the function declarations are displayed as <code>myFunction(var, str) -> var</code> for a function taking a variable and string parameter and returning a variable. Programmers might recognize this as being inspired by the trailing return types from C++11.

<h5>Navigation by keyboard</h5>
<ul>
<li>Open the panel or brings it to the front with CTRL+0 (zero)
<li>Jump to the definition of the listbox selection with "." (dot)
<li>Pressing any character while the ListBox has the focus will jump to the first listbox entry which starts with that character.
</ul>

<h5>Limitations</h5>
<ul>
<li>No parameter types shown for macros
<li>No entries for Constant, StrConstant definitions 
</ul>
Lifting the limitations would currently require to manually parse the procedure file.
